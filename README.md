# Android Challenge

Android Cabify.es job interview Challenge sample app.

# WHAT

Sample app the uses a public API that will allow third party apps use a well known taxi cabs service. The main goal of the app is to get an estimate for a certain route from the origin to a destination using the public api for this challenge.

What is expected is an app that allows users to pick an origin and a destination and, using the public API, give them an estimated price for every vehicle type. The ideal way to achieve that was through a map where the user can select the origin and destination and show the results in a list, letting the user know how much is going to cost for each vehicle type.
